A network programming project showcasing various features for efficient network operations.

## Features

1. **Multi-Threaded SHA Digest:**
   - Efficiently compute SHA digests of files using multi-threading.
   - Ensure faster processing of large datasets with parallelized computations.

2. **Multi-Threaded Web Log Executor:**
   - Execute web logs concurrently to simulate realistic traffic scenarios.
   - Utilize multi-threading to handle multiple log entries simultaneously.

3. **INET Addressing:**
   - Implement INET addressing for robust network communication.
   - Ensure compatibility and standardization in network addressing.

4. **Concurrent Response Cache:**
   - Maintain a concurrent cache for storing and retrieving responses.
   - Optimize response time by handling cache operations concurrently.
